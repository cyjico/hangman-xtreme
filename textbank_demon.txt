raining cats and dogs
break a leg
off the beaten path
it takes two to tango
let it be
every cloud has a silver lining
piece of cake
let the cat out of the bag
the early bird
get a taste of your own medicine
walking on eggshells
burn the midnight oil
don’t cry over spilled milk
kill two birds with one stone
once in a blue moon
beat around the bush
a blessing in disguise
pulling your leg
under the weather
go the extra mile
through thick and thin
sit on the fence
kick the bucket
spill the beans
speak of the devil
leave no stone unturned
barking up the wrong tree
on thin ice
keep your chin up
hit the hay
miss the boat
back to square one
a drop in the bucket
steal someone’s thunder
reading between the lines
jump on the bandwagon
take it with a grain of salt
when pigs fly
see eye to eye
rock the boat
a dime a dozen
giving the cold shoulder
hit the nail on the head
bite the bullet
you can’t judge a book by its cover
cut to the chase
time is money
the ball is in your court
no pain no gain
throw in the towel
personal computers explode
i yearned for the mines
bend over backwards
let sleeping dogs lie
cry wolf
throw caution to the wind
the last straw
cost an arm and a leg
storm in a teacup
add fuel to the fire
get cold feet
out of the frying pan and into the fire
skeletons in the closet
draw the line
have a chip on your shoulder
throw someone under the bus
give someone the benefit of the doubt
shoot for the stars
pull a rabbit out of a hat
make a mountain out of a molehill
off one’s rocker
stick your neck out
have your hands full
drop the ball
turn a blind eye
cold feet
keep something at bay
